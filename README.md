## 1. Login (User ID) and User Profile
![useridpage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3ba8686-01f2-4b23-b3f6-549417c0e353)

The first page you will see is the Login (User ID) page. Currently, the only way to access the application is to enter a User ID. More authentication
and authorization measures will be added later.

![profileinfo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b55f2a50-61dd-469e-ba2b-5edf0bd3fb0c)

Once you enter in your User ID, you can access any part of the application, including the User Profile page. Here, you can view your profile information,
including: 
-Name, Phone and Email
-Username
-Website
-Address
-Company information

From here, you can navigate to other parts of the application by either clicking the View Posts or View Photos buttons, or by utilizing the Navigation Bar
at the top of the page.

## 2. Post Operations
![dashboardposts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceebec10-0014-4bcb-ad6e-ec578e3403cb)

Upon entering your User ID on the Login page, you will be redirected to the Posts dashboard.  Here, you can view any post you have written and read the comments
people have made on each post. You can also filter posts using the responsive search bar at the top of the page. In addition to this, there are \
three other things you can do:

### Create a New Post
At the top of the page, you will find three buttons -- one of them, labeled "Make a New Post", is for creating a new post, as the name suggests.

![createpost](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb74b45-cfb0-4f0a-8067-1e41b3084354)

Here, you can fill out the Title and Body fields to create more content for your dashboard. 

### Edit Post
Similar in appearance, this form allows you to edit a post you already completed. Navigate here by clicking the "Edit Post" button next to any of your posts.\

![editpost](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1845d4dc-8220-4904-b7a3-abea1c65179d)

__Note__: While the body of a post may be edited however you please, the Title may not be changed upon post creation. If you wish to change the title, you will have to delete the post and write a new one.

### Delete Post
To delete a post, click on the "Delete Post" button located next to every post. A warning will display, allowing you to cancel if you don't want to delete
it after all.

## 3. Photo Albums
![photoalbums](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9cec5c6-0c9a-4bc9-a46c-9157b0fe959f)

This page will display any photo albums you've added to your profile. If you click the "View Photos" button, it will display all the photos in that album.

![extendedphotos](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce7522a5-e397-4a76-9f4d-d1ebe0666f2a)

This page also has a dynamic search bar for filtering through photo albums.
__NOTE__: the photos here are taken from an example using GraphQLZero API. You will have to replace with a different API if you wish to use real photos.

## 4. Todo List
![todos](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/963882aa-0802-4ee7-beff-f57f52a558af)
The Todo List contains a list of Todo Items, which can by filtered using the search bar, or organized by completion status using the dropdown menu:

![sorttodos](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/368b6787-7c2b-4a73-96c2-1f1552a0092a)

To mark a task as complete, click the box marked "Mark as complete". To remove a Todo Item, click the "Delete Item" button on the right hand side of the item you wish to delete.
